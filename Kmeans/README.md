# Project Summary

**I will create and demonstrate a K-Means clustering algorithm in this jupyter-notebook. In general, clustering is classified as an unsupervised machine learning approach that enable us to cluster data and find the data pattern. In addition, K-means is one of the most common techniques of clustering. In the last part of this project, I will include K-means implementation from scikit-learn package.**

**Project Steps:**

1. Scale datasets to standardize values.
2. Identify the number of clusters (usually referred to as k).
3. Initialize the random centroid for each cluster. (The centroid = the center of the cluster)
4. Determine data labels by searching for the closest centroid to each data point.
5. Update the centroids based on the geometric mean of all the data points in the cluster.
6. Iterate 4 - 5 until the centroids stop changing.
